## Purpose (or “Why bother?”)

Here lies the **digital graveyard of my sanity**—a portfolio for showcasing my full-stack developer skills (not exactly but yes).  
I build apps, websites, and other digital nonsense that (hopefully) solves problems, entertains, or at least makes me look like I know what I’m doing.  

If you’re here, congrats—you now know someone spent way too much caffeine and time making things that may or may not change the world.

## Technologies I Work With (aka “The Dark Magic I Wield”)

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript — because ugly interfaces are unforgivable  
- **Animations:** Framer Motion — because even code deserves to move gracefully  
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot — for when things need brains, not just looks  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB — because data is the real overlord  
- **Deployment & Hosting:** Vercel — makes me look like a professional, instantly  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub — because losing code is a sin

## Features (or “Stuff that works… sometimes”)

- **Project Showcase:** Check out the apps I tortured into existence  
- **Responsive Design:** Works on mobile too, because apparently people use phones  
- **Interactive Cards:** Click, admire, or judge—I don’t care  
- **Modern UI/UX:** Pretty enough to distract from the bugs

**Summary:**  
This portfolio is my attempt to look like I know what I’m doing while actually surviving on caffeine, code, and questionable life choices.
